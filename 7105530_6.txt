The Challenge:
The customer would like to port the entire system to the Amazon Cloud. Propose a solution for this customer, including architectural patterns and a migration path that minimizes risk.

Answare:
this  solution was devloped using  reactjs +spring boot+sprin data+mangodb

To run this app first run the mongodb then launch the spring boot and then can start webpak dev server

for free text search mongo db is used as mongodb has now text search cabality , but we to improve performance we easly change the code to include elastic search,

if we use elastic search with mongo db , we have to make the data consistent that is a challenging task.We can use third party driver that help in keeping data between one slave of mongo db and elastic server in shync.

the better solution will be  to go in micorservices way and create a service app for search and we can use messaging to keep mongo  db and elastic serach in shync
 


If user want to move the app to cloud , then we can foolw 12 factor app best practices so that services will become configurable and staeless.
create the service bounderies using bounded context so that if cutomer wants we can divide the services to microservices
